So I cant really figure out how to actually customise my existing theme or create a new theme for the website entirely. I had the idea that I would customise the blog a bit more before I started pushing in actual blog posts, but I figured I should start posting just for some dopamine hits and also so that I dont go crazy looking at the same few default blog posts everytime I lock up this site or do go to `localhost:4000`. 

I think this is a cool idea, posting here as I keep building this site. After all part of this site's purpose is journaling and this is a good start. I'll start removing the default posts as I fill the blog up with these. To keep these a little exciting until the "real" content starts coming, I'll try to use some new markdown feature every post. 

Okay so I enabled `detect Jekyll Front Matter` and another feature to render TeX let's test it: 

$$y^3 = x^2 + Ax + B$$

Yup it works. That's a lot of new features for one post. I'll push this to Github pages. It really takes very long for the deployment to actually update. 

Here's a random adjacency matrix just for fun.

$$ A=
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\
1 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\
0 && 1 && 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\
1 && 0 && 0 && 0 && 0 && 1 \\
0 && 1 && 1 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\
0 && 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Tomorrow I'll see how I can fit more complicated latex and figures into this.

I almost `:wq`'ed out of this.
