So I cant really figure out how to actually customise my existing theme or create a new theme for the website entirely. I had the idea that I would customise the blog a bit more before I started pushing in actual blog posts, but I figured I should start posting just for some dopamine hits and also so that I dont go crazy looking at the same few default blog posts everytime I lock up this site or do go to `localhost:4000`.
